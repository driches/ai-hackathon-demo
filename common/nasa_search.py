NASA Document Search Module - Vector Database and RAG Implementation

This module implements the NASA document search capability using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approach. It provides executive-level insights from NASA technical
documents by combining semantic search with LLM generation.

RAG ARCHITECTURE:
1. Vector Database (Chroma): Stores document embeddings for semantic search
2. Embedding Model: Converts text to vector representations for similarity matching
3. Retrieval: Finds most relevant document chunks for a given query
4. Generation: Uses LLM to synthesize executive-level responses from retrieved context

DESIGN PATTERNS:
- Lazy Loading: Database and LLM initialized only when needed (performance)
- Singleton Pattern: Global instances for efficient resource usage
- Factory Pattern: Tool creation for agent integration
- Template Method: Consistent search-then-generate workflow

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Lazy loading prevents unnecessary resource allocation at startup
- Vector similarity search provides fast semantic matching
- Chunked documents enable precise context retrieval
- Executive-focused prompts produce concise, relevant responses

    This class implements a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:
    
    COMPONENTS:
    - Vector Database (Chroma): Stores preprocessed NASA document embeddings
    - Embedding Model: Converts queries to vectors for semantic similarity
    - LLM: Generates executive-level responses from retrieved context
    
    WORKFLOW:
    1. Query received → Convert to embedding vector
    2. Semantic search → Find most similar document chunks
    3. Context assembly → Combine relevant chunks
    4. LLM generation → Synthesize executive-level response
    
    LAZY LOADING DESIGN:
    Database and LLM connections are created only when first accessed.
    This prevents resource allocation during module import and enables
    faster application startup times.
