Agent Factory Module - AI Agent Creation and Configuration

This module implements the Factory Pattern for creating and configuring AI agents
with appropriate tools and system prompts. It handles the complex orchestration
of NASA document search capabilities and optional MCP tool integration.

FACTORY PATTERN BENEFITS:
- Encapsulates complex agent creation logic
- Provides consistent agent configuration across the application
- Enables easy testing with different configurations
- Centralizes tool integration and prompt generation

AGENT ARCHITECTURE:
The agents created by this factory follow the React (Reasoning + Acting) pattern:
1. Receive user input
2. Reason about what tools to use
3. Execute tools to gather information
4. Synthesize results into coherent responses

TOOL INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
- NASA Search: Always included for document retrieval capabilities
- MCP Tools: Conditionally included based on server availability
- Dynamic Prompts: System prompts adapt based on available tools
- Error Isolation: Tool failures don't crash the entire agent

    Factory for creating and configuring AI agents with tools and prompts.
    
    This class encapsulates the complex logic of agent creation:
    - Model configuration and parameter tuning
    - Tool discovery and integration
    - System prompt generation based on available capabilities
    - Error handling and graceful degradation
    
    CONFIGURATION FLEXIBILITY:
    The factory allows customization of:
    - AI model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
    - Temperature settings for response creativity
    - Tool inclusion/exclusion for different use cases
    - Custom prompt templates for specialized behavior
    
    DESIGN PATTERNS:
    - Factory Pattern: Centralized object creation
    - Builder Pattern: Step-by-step agent configuration
    - Strategy Pattern: Different tool sets for different scenarios
    - Template Method: Consistent agent creation flow
