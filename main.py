NASA Document Q&A System - Simplified Main Application

This is the entry point for the NASA Document Q&A System, which provides
intelligent question-answering capabilities for NASA technical documents.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
This application follows a modular, clean architecture pattern:

1. Configuration Layer (common.config): Handles environment setup and validation
2. Data Layer (common.nasa_search): Manages vector database and document retrieval  
3. Integration Layer (common.mcp_client): Handles external MCP server connections
4. Agent Layer (common.agent_factory): Creates and configures AI agents
5. Presentation Layer (this file): Provides user interface and interaction

DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
- Singleton Pattern: For configuration and client instances
- Factory Pattern: For agent creation with different configurations
- Dependency Injection: Components receive their dependencies cleanly
- Strategy Pattern: Different tool sets based on MCP availability
- Command Pattern: User queries processed through agent invocation

FLOW:
User Input → Configuration Loading → Agent Creation → Tool Integration → Response Generation

    Main application entry point and interaction loop.
    
    This function orchestrates the entire application lifecycle:
    1. Loads and validates configuration from environment
    2. Creates an AI agent with appropriate tools (NASA + MCP)
    3. Runs an interactive question-answering loop
    4. Handles errors gracefully and provides user feedback
    
    ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
    - Single responsibility: Only handles user interaction and flow control
    - Dependency injection: Gets all dependencies from common modules
    - Error isolation: Catches and handles errors without crashing
    - User experience: Provides clear feedback and status information
